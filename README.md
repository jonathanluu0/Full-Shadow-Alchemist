Introduction
Game Summary Pitch
	A dark alchemist that is looking to overthrow the filthy capitalist government that has since allowed the big companies to monopolize all the economic wealth.
Inspiration
Vampire survivor is a main inspiration for this game. Vampire survivor features one main character that can be controlled by an individual, and will automatically fire at nearby enemies. The game will have auto generating enemies that drop experience allowing for the player to gain stats on leveling.

Player Experience
This game demo will feature the very basics of the Vampire Survivors concepts of moving with WASD, attacking with LMB, and trying to survive as long as possible.

Platform
The targeted platform will be for the browser on itch.io

Target Audience

Concept
Gameplay overview
The player is going to control a female alchemist. The goal is to survive as long as possible against the shadow assassins sent by the government to halt your studies and experiments. Thus, you set out on your journey to flee, and on this journey you will discover new potions to help strengthen you on your adventure.

Theme Interpretation
Since it is going to play exactly like slay the spire it is going to include a lot of inventory management. Sure you can tell yourself to constantly add flasks to your bag, but then you lose consistency in what flasks you might pull out in the middle of combat. But remember you might want to keep those key flasks to create those powerful combinations.

Art
Theme Interpretation
We looked for assets that resemble mages, fantasy shadow creatures, and potions that would look like powerups.

Design
The art we used are free assets provided by Unity as our time is focused on gameplay.
Audio
Music
If we had the time to implement music it would be intense and suspensful survival music.
Sound Effects
If we had the time to implement SFX, we would add screeches and metal attack swings for the shadow assassins, fireball and magic SFX, and running sounds for the player.

Game Experience
UI
Quite colorful will include a button for checking your bag. A hand of flasks/cards to represent your potion belt, and a slew of colors to better help interpret visually what flask you have or are going to throw.
Controls
Keyboard
